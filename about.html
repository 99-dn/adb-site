            <div>
              Agricultural Development Bank of Ghana, commonly known as
              Agricultural Development Bank or ADB, is a government-owned
              development and commercial bank in Ghana. The bank is the first
              development finance institution established by the Government of
              Ghana. It is the developmental finance institution that provides
              technical and financial services to agribusiness, farmers, and
              other enterprises at the rural communities. It is one of the
              commercial banks licensed by the Bank of Ghana, the national
              banking regulator. The main objective of the bank is promoting and
              financing of agribusiness in the country. ADB was established in
              1965, by the Act of Parliament (Act 286) as the Agricultural
              Credit and Cooperative Bank. This is to meet the banking needs of
              the Ghanaian agricultural sector in a profitable manner. The bank
              started operations from a building on Tunisia Road, West Ridge -
              Accra. The bank changed its name in 1970 when the parliamentary
              statute was amended to grant the institution full commercial
              banking powers. In 1967, the National Liberation Council (NLC
              Decree 182) renamed it from the Agricultural Credit and
              Cooperative Bank to the Agricultural Development Bank, and amended
              key sections of the Establishing Act, Act 286. By 1990, the bank
              became more diversified and added international banking and trade
              services to its growing product portfolio. The bank obtained the
              Universal Banking license and broadened its services in 2004. In
              2011 the branch network of the bank expanded from 55 to 78
              branches across the country, with fully networked branches running
              on an ICT platform. Around the same time, the bank introduced the
              ADB Visa Classic Card, allowing cardholders to transact business
              anywhere in the world.
